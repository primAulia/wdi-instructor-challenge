## FLICKIES

### GOAL

> Welcome to Flickies. This is a standalone project made for General Assembly Instructor Challenge
  https://github.com/rachlim/wdi-instructor-challenge

#### Installation

- I've removed the ruby-backend-starter-code for clarity sake

- 

- Both back-ends contain several errors that commonly made by students, so you will need to do some debugging to ensure they are working correctly.

#### Front-end Instructions

- Use Vanilla Javascript to complete.

- The page should have a form that uses the [OMDBapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for matching movies and then display the results.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `Star Wars`, a list of every Star Wars movie will be displayed.

- When the user clicks on a search result display detailed information about that movie.
  - *Example*: If a user is viewing a list of every Star Wars movie and clicks on `Star Wars: A New Hope`, detailed information about that specific movie will be displayed.

- Users should be able to "favorite" a movie and have it persisted via the provided back-end.

- Provide a link to display favorited movies.

#### Things we are looking for

- Clear, simple code
- Explanatory comments for beginners
- Consistent Naming Conventions
- Valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Deliverables

- Please fork [this repo](https://github.com/generalassembly-hk/wdi-instructor-challenge) and send us a pull request with the completed code challenge.

- Include a README.md file in your repo with a link to your application deployed on Heroku or Digital Ocean.

#### Bonus

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library
- Use code linting to check and enforce consistent code syntax.
- Add unit tests and code coverage metrics to establish confidence when refactoring.
- Connect your deployment via a continuous integration service like Travis, Circle, or Codeship.

**Happy Coding!!**
